# Simple Markdown Site

## Known differences between Github and Github Pages

* No automatic links with Github Pages. The Github Markdown renderer can automatically detect a simple copy-pasted link and make it a clickable link. Github Pages doesn't propose a feature to reproduce that behavior, so you'll have to braces your links with the `[]()` syntax.

## Recipes

Since the purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to publish multiple Markdown files as a website but I don't have much more to say I will propose to you some delicious recipes instead:

* [Escalivada](./recipes/Escalivada.md)
* [Gazpacho](./recipes/Gazpacho.md)
* [Pasta all'amatriciana](./recipes/Pasta_all_amatriciana.md)
